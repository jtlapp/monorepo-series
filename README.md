# monorepo-series

Example monorepos for my "Sharing TypeScript with Nx and Turborepo" series

## Archive of with-tailwind

The [`with-tailwind`](https://github.com/jtlapp/monorepo-series/tree/main/with-tailwind) directory contains an archive of Vercel's [`with-tailwind` example monorepo](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/main/examples/with-tailwind), copied on February 25, 2023. My series references this archive because this is the version of the example that it describes, in case the original example changes.

## Archive of the basic monorepo

The [`basic`](https://github.com/jtlapp/monorepo-series/tree/main/basic) directory contains an archive of Turborepo's [official basic example](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/main/examples/basic), copied on February 25, 2023. It does not contain any additional installations, such as TailwindCSS.
